The video demonstrates the way in which our website works and the options available in our website Through this website we plan to make it user friendly by letting them upload there favourite tracks and convert it into lofi beats It can also create playlists as per the given track. The first window is the homescreen where we can upload our song and play it,through this window we are directed towards other inbuilt tracks so where we can slide through pages and listen to diffferent music.
